## Privacy

ReKindle is designed with privacy as a priority.

*   **Guest Mode:** By default, ReKindle uses your browser's `localStorage`. No data leaves your device.
*   **Cloud Sync:** If you choose to log in, app-specific data (notes, tasks, game states) is synced securely via Google Firebase.
*   **Google Data:** Google Tokens are stored locally on your device. ReKindle fetches Calendar/Contacts/Tasks data directly from Google APIs to your browser; this data is **never** stored on ReKindle servers.

## License

**ReKindle** is licensed under the **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License**.

You are free to share and adapt the work for non-commercial purposes, provided you give appropriate credit and distribute your contributions under the same license.

## ☁️ Cloud & API Configuration (For Developers)

To enable full functionality (cloud sync, Google integrations, and AI features), you will need to set up your own backend services.

### 1. Firebase Setup (Required for Sync & Auth)
ReKindle uses Google Firebase for user authentication and storing app data.
1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a project.
2.  Enable **Email/Password** authentication.
3.  Enable **Firestore Database** and set security rules to restrict access to owner-only.

### 2. Google API Setup (Optional for Google Sync)
Enable the **Google Tasks**, **Calendar**, and **People** APIs in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID for a Web Application and add your domain to the authorized origins.

### 3. Cloudflare Workers (Backend Proxies)
ReKindle uses specialized Cloudflare Workers to handle sensitive API requests and bypass CORS:
*   **Oracle AI:** Proxies requests to the Google Gemini API.
*   **Quick ToDo OCR:** Handles image processing and OCR for handwritten tasks.
*   **Watchlist (TMDB):** Securely fetches movie and show data.
*   **Chords:** Fetches song tabs and lyrics.
*   **Story (IFDB):** Serves interactive fiction stories.
*   **Stripe:** Manages supporter status and donations.
*   **Translate:** Proxies translation requests.

## 🛠️ Building & Deployment

To build the project for different devices, run:
```bash
node build-automation.js
```

This creates three optimized targets in the `_deploy` directory:

1.  **Main (`_deploy/main`):** For modern browsers (Desktop, Mobile). Minified with ES6+ features.
2.  **Lite (`_deploy/lite`):** Optimized for **Kobo** and newer **Kindle** devices (Chrome 44+). Includes local polyfills, transpiled ES5 code, and Kobo-specific fixes (e.g., window handling, WebM video fallbacks).
3.  **Legacy (`_deploy/legacy`):** Designed for very old devices (Chrome 12+ / e.g., Paperwhite 2). Features aggressive transpilation, heavy polyfills, and visual warnings for unsupported applications.
